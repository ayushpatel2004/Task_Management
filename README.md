#TaskHub

>Collaborate and build.

Developing group projects and maintaining progress of the team members has always been tiresome. To overcome this situation we have developed 'TaskHub' which assigns task to the members and also tracks their progress so others can keep track of the project.

We have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend. Django is used for the backend. 

The project is deployed on Replit.
